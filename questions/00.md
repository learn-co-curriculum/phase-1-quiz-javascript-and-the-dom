# DOM: DevTools

The following code block is a snippet of HTML from Ian's portfolio page:

```html
<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Hello!</h1>
<section>
  <h1 id="name" class="name">My name is Ian!</h1>
  <h1 id="welcome" class="welcome">Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque
    lacinia pretium feugiat. Praesent tincidunt non odio sed ultricies. Fusce
    cursus nisi quis est varius imperdiet.
  </p>
</section>
```

If I am viewing this HTML in the browser, what text will be returned if I type
the following into the console?

```javascript
document.querySelector("h1").textContent;
```

> Feel free to copy and paste if you need to!

## Correct

Hello!

> Nice! `querySelector()`returns the **first** element that matches the given
> CSS selector, so in this case that would be the very first `<h1>` tag! Calling
> `.textContent` on that element would return the text from that `<h1>` tag,
> which is `Hello!`

## Correct

'Hello!'

> Nice! `querySelector()`returns the **first** element that matches the given
> CSS selector, so in this case that would be the very first `<h1>` tag! Calling
> `.textContent` on that element would return the text from that `<h1>` tag,
> which is `'Hello!'`

## Correct

"Hello!"

> Nice! `querySelector()`returns the **first** element that matches the given
> CSS selector, so in this case that would be the very first `<h1>` tag! Calling
> `.textContent` on that element would return the text from that `<h1>` tag,
> which is `"Hello!"`
